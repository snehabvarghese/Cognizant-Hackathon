    Returns ONE freshly generated interview question for the given role, topic, and difficulty.

    **How it works (ChromaDB is always consulted first):**

    1. **ChromaDB grounding** — fetches up to 3 real Stack Overflow examples from the
       question bank using a smart cascade:
       - Tries exact `role + topic + difficulty` match first.
       - If not found: drops topic, keeps difficulty.
       - If still not found: tries adjacent difficulty levels (Medium → Easy → Hard).
       - If still not found: falls back to role-only examples.
       Any unknown role (e.g. `ML Engineer`, `iOS Developer`) is automatically mapped
       to the nearest group (`Backend Engineer`, `Frontend Engineer`, etc.).

    2. **Gemini generation** — the retrieved examples + adaptation notes are injected
       into a structured prompt. Gemini generates a *brand-new* question in the same
       style, at the correct difficulty, specifically for the requested role and topic.
       Up to 3 Gemini models are tried with 2 retries each before giving up.

    3. **Emergency fallback** *(only if Gemini API is completely unavailable)* —
       returns an existing ChromaDB question directly. `source` field will be
       `"chromadb"` instead of `"gemini"` so you can tell which path was taken.

    4. **404** — only if both Gemini and ChromaDB return nothing (extremely unlikely).

    **`source` field values:**
    - `"gemini"` → fresh AI-generated question grounded on ChromaDB examples ✅
    - `"chromadb"` → existing question served directly (Gemini API was unavailable)

    1. ChromaDB cascade fetches up to 10 reference questions for the topic:
